# Game AI Agents

This project implements various AI agents and algorithms for game playing and reinforcement learning. The project includes multiple agent implementations including Q-Learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo, and Minimax algorithms.

## Implemented Agents

### Q-Learning Agent

An implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, which learns an optimal action-selection policy through experience and value iteration.

### SARSA Agent

State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) implementation, an on-policy learning algorithm for temporal difference learning.

### Monte Carlo Agent

Implements Monte Carlo methods for learning from complete episodes of experience.

### Minimax Agent

A traditional game-playing algorithm for perfect information adversarial games.

### Random Agent

A baseline agent that makes random moves, useful for testing and comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
